Vintage Story Challenges
=====

These challenges are designed to be played in Wilderness Survival, with Permadeath turned on. There are five tiers of challenge; from simple casual challenges, to challenges designed specifically to kill you... or at least take you to the very brink.

I'm Too Young to Die! (Tier 0)
-----

These minor challenges shouldn't pose too much of a problem. It'd be possible to complete a few of these within a single run.

| # | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Traveller (Novice)** | Travel at least 2,000 blocks in every cardinal direction away from World Spawn.
| 2 | **Bakers' Dozen** | Bake a bakers' dozen of pies. Each one should be uniquely flavoured.
| 3 | **Green Fingers** | Create a greenhouse containing at least 25 unique plant types.
| 4 | **Art Gallery** | Display at least 15 unique artistic works within a single room.
| 5 | **Games Master** | Create a working mini-game, that can be played solo, or with multiple players.
| 6 | **Geologist** | Obtain samples of at least 15 unique types of rock.

Hey, Not Too Rough! (Tier 1)
-----

Slightly more involved than the previous Tier; these challenges are designed to test and explore the basic core concepts of the game. They may take a long time, but none of the challenges themselves put the player in any directly hazardrous situation.

| # | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Traveller (Adept)** | Travel at least 5,000 blocks in every cardinal direction away from World Spawn.

| 5 | **Farmville** | Raise a breeding pair of animals to Generation 10.
| 6 | **A Lifetime Supply of Charcoal** | Fill and burn a max-sized charcoal pit.

Hurt Me Plenty! (Tier 2)
-----

Taking the training wheels off, these challenges deal with progression, exploration, lateral thinking, and combat.

| # | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Traveller (Journeyman)** | Travel at least 10,000 blocks in every cardinal direction away from World Spawn.
| 2 | **Beast Master** | Capture a male and female of each animal type.

| 4 | **Iron Man** | Construct a full set of Iron gear and armour.

| 6 | **What Has It Got In Its Pocketses?** | Increase your inventory size to maximum, with four leather backpacks.

Ultra-Violence! (Tier 3)
-----

These challenges actively push the player into inherently dangerous situations, and will require a lot more time and effort to complete. 

| # | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Traveller (Expert)** | Travel at least 20,000 blocks in every direction away from World Spawn.
| 2 | **Trophy Hunter** | Hunt and kill at least one of each creature type.
| 3 | **Metallurgic Master** | Smelt at least one ingot of every available metal type.

| 5 | **Man of Steel** | Construct a full set of Steel gear (weapons, and tools) and armour.
| 6 | **Hack the Planet!** | As a Clock Maker, kill one of each Drifter type and Locust type, using only your own locust army.

NIGHTMARE!!!!! (Tier 4)
-----

When attempting a **NIGHTMARE** level challenge, the following extra rules apply:  
  
 1. You may not use beds, even during a Temporal Storm.
 2. You may not use poultices to recover health.
 3. You may not choose the *Clock Maker* class.

These challenges are not for the feint-hearted. They are designed to test your knowledge of the game to the maximum. Some will actively try to kill you in the pursuit of victory.

| # | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Traveller (Master)** | Travel at least 50,000 blocks in every direction away from World Spawn.
| 2 | **HALO Jump** | Survive a jump from world height, landing at sea level, or below.
| 3 | **Ceremonial Garb** | Construct a full set of Gold gear (weapons, and tools) and armour.
| 4 | **Pest Control** | Clear 20 locust nests, and kill at least three of each type of locust.
| 5 | **Nomad** | Survive for a year, never staying within 200 blocks of where you spent the previous night, and never returning to previous rest site.
| 6 | **Challenge Anneka** | Complete one challenge from Tier 4 (this one), two from Tier 3, three from tier 2, four from Tier 1, and five from Tier 0. Only one Traveller challenge can be chosen in total.

**BONUS TIER:** Legendary (Tier 5)
-----

When attempting a **Legendary** level challenge, the following extra rules apply:  
  
 1. You may not use beds, even during a Temporal Storm.
 2. You may not use poultices to recover health.
 3. You may not choose the *Clock Maker* class.
 4. You may not wear armour of any kind.

Only for the most ardent of acheivement hoarders, these Legendary challenges are the ultimate trophies. Bragging rights are well deserved, for completing any of these challeges. I dare you to complete them all. I bet you won't.
